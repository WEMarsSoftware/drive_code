# Pinout for ESP-32 running this project's drive code
Note that pins in each category correspond to a specific wheel/motor.
For example, one left motor will have PWM output on pin 32, a rotary encoder connected
to pins (A) 13 and (B) 37, and a current sensor connected to pin 9.

# Motor PWM Signals
- Left Side Motors:
	- PIN 32, 33, 25
- Right Side Motors:
	- PINS 4, 2, 15

# Motor Rotary Encoders
- 'A' Pin Inputs: 13, 12, 14, 27, 26, 21
- 'B' Pin Inputs: 37, 39, 36, 34, 23, 22

# Motor Current Sensors
- 9, 10, 11, 19, 18, 5
